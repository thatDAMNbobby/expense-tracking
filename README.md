# expense-tracking

A simple application to allow tracking of expenses.
Uses local storage to persist data.

Written as a way to learn mithril js. 

Future: 
- Use google sheets for the data to enable use across devices
- Aggregations on individual, multiple, all of the attributes
- Maybe some nice graphs?
